      "-->E-commerce\n",
      "-->We also serve customers through our e-commerce business, which includes websites for the J.Crew, factory and Madewell brands. Our websites allow customers to purchase our merchandise over the Internet and include jcrew.com, jcrewfactory.com and madewell.com, and in responsive formats available on mobile phones and tablets. We also use our websites to sell exclusive styles not available in stores, introduce and test new product offerings, offer extended sizes and colors on various products, and drive targeted marketing campaigns. Additionally, we utilize a third party to accept and fulfill online orders from customers in over 100 countries outside of the United States.\n",
      "-->Financial Information about Segments\n",
      "-->We have determined our operating segments on the same basis that we use to internally evaluate performance and allocate resources. Our operating segments align with our brands, J.Crew and Madewell, which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they have similar class of consumers, economic characteristics, nature of products, nature of production and distribution methods.\n",
      "-->Shared Resources That Support Our Brands\n",
      "-->Design and Merchandising\n",
      "-->On the basis of data collected from customers through our e-commerce business, we believe our customer base consists primarily of college-educated, professional and fashion-conscious women and men. We seek to appeal to our customers by creating high quality products that reflect our customers  aspirational and active lifestyles across a broad range of price points.\n",
      "-->We believe one of our key strengths is our design team, which designs merchandise that reinforces our constantly evolving brands. Our collections are designed to reflect a clean and fashionable aesthetic that incorporates high quality fabrics and construction as well as consistent fits and detailing.\n",
      "-->Our products are developed in four seasonal collections and are rolled-out for monthly product introductions in our stores, on our websites and in our catalogs. The design process begins with our designers developing seasonal collections eight to 12 months in advance. Our designers travel domestically and internationally to develop color and design ideas. Once the design team has developed a season s color palette and design concepts, they order a sample assortment in order to evaluate the details of the collection, such as how color takes to a particular fabric. The design team then presents the collection to senior management. The presentation reflects the design team s vision, from color direction and flow, to styling and silhouette evolution.\n",
      "-->5\n",
      "-->Our teams work closely with each other in order to leverage market data, ensure the quality of our products and remain true to our unified brand aesthetic and voice. Our technical design team develops construction and f it specifications for every product, to enable quality workmanship and consistency across product lines.\n",
      "-->Because our product offerings originate from a single concept assortment, we believe that we are able to efficiently offer an assortment of styles within each season s line while still maintaining a unified vision. As a final step that is intended to ensure image consistency, our senior management reviews the full line of products for each season before they are manufactured.\n",
      "-->Marketing and Advertising\n",
      "-->As part of our omni-strategy, we communicate a consistent brand message across our stores, our websites, our direct mail, email marketing, online advertising, and our social media presence. Our core marketing objectives are structured to drive awareness and differentiation of our brands, increase new customer acquisition, maintain and build customer retention and loyalty, and enhance brand awareness globally.\n",
      "-->Digital marketing and social media have played an important part of our strategy and are among our most effective marketing tools. Additionally, we have redesigned and upgraded our mobile responsive site, which features a more intuitive and user-friendly experience for shoppable content. This redesign supports our ongoing initiative to serve our customers with an integrated omni-channel shopping experience.\n",
      "-->We offer a private-label credit card in our J.Crew brand which is issued and serviced by a third-party provider. In fiscal 2016, sales on the J.Crew credit card made up approximately 15% of our net sales. We believe that our credit card program encourages frequent store and website visits and promotes multiple-item purchases, thereby cultivating customer loyalty to the J.Crew brand and increasing sales. The J.Crew credit card offers rewards based on customer spend.\n",
      "-->Sourcing\n",
      "-->We source our merchandise in two ways: (i) through the use of buying agents, and (ii) by purchasing merchandise directly from trading companies and manufacturers. We have no long-term merchandise supply contracts, and we typically transact business on an order-by-order basis. In fiscal 2016, we worked with 9 buying agents, who supported our relationships with vendors that supplied approximately 62% of our merchandise, with one of these buying agents supporting our relationships with vendors that supplied approximately 48% of our merchandise. In exchange for a commission, our buying agents identify suitable vendors and coordinate our purchasing requirements with the vendors by placing orders for merchandise on our behalf, ensuring the timely delivery of goods to us, obtaining samples of merchandise produced in the factories, inspecting finished merchandise and carrying out other administrative communications on our behalf. In fiscal 2016, we worked with a number of trading companies, through which we purchased approximately 21% of our merchandise. Trading companies control factories that manufacture merchandise and also handle certain other shipping and customs matters related to importing the merchandise into the United States. We sourced the remaining 17% of our merchandise directly from manufacturers within the United States and overseas, the majority of whom we have long-term, and in our opinion, stable relationships.\n",
      "-->Our sourcing base currently consists of 200 vendors who operate 339 factories in 25 countries. Our top 10 vendors supply 40% of our merchandise. Each of our top 10 vendors uses multiple factories to produce its merchandise, which we believe gives us a high degree of flexibility in placing production of our merchandise. We believe we have developed strong relationships with our vendors, some of which rely upon us for a significant portion of their business.\n",
      "-->In fiscal 2016, approximately 86% of our merchandise was sourced in Asia (with 58% of our products sourced from China and Hong Kong), 11% was sourced in Europe and other regions, and 3% was sourced in the United States. Substantially all of our foreign purchases are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars.\n",
      "-->Distribution\n",
      "-->We own a 282,000 square foot facility in Asheville, North Carolina that houses our distribution operations for our stores. This facility employed approximately 320 full and part-time associates as of January 28, 2017. Merchandise is transported from this distribution center to our stores by independent trucking companies, with a transit time of approximately two to five days.\n",
      "-->6\n",
      "-->We also own two facilities in Lynchburg, Virginia with a combined total square footage of 488,700 square feet . These facilities contain a customer call center and order fulfill ment operations for our e-commerce business. The Lynchburg facilities employed approximately 1,170 full and part-time associates as of January 28, 2017. These facilities employ approximately 170 additional associates during our peak season. Merchandise sol d through our e-commerce business is sent directly to domestic customers from this distribution center or our stores via the United States Postal Service, or UPS. W e utilize a thi rd party to accept and fulfill online orders from customers in over 100 count ries ou tside of the United States.\n",
      "-->In fiscal 2016, we commenced discussions regarding sale-lease back transactions of our distribution facilities.\n",
      "-->We lease a 45,800 square foot customer call center in San Antonio, Texas. This facility employed approximately 330 full and part-time associates as of January 28, 2017. This facility employs approximately 80 additional associates during our peak season.\n",
      "-->Management Information Systems\n",
      "-->Our management information systems are designed to provide comprehensive order processing, production, accounting and management information for the marketing, manufacturing, importing, distribution, financial reporting, and analytical functions of our business. Our in-store point-of-sale systems, e-commerce platforms and support systems provide the omni-channel capability to enable us to track inventory from store receipt to final sale on a real-time basis. We have an agreement with a third party to provide hosting services and administrative support for portions of our infrastructure, and utilize cloud based systems in addition to those hosted on premise.\n",
      "-->We believe our merchandising and financial systems, coupled with our point-of-sale and e-commerce systems, allow for item-level stock replenishment, merchandise planning and real-time inventory accounting capabilities. Our telephone and call center systems, warehouse package sorting systems, automated warehouse locator, order management systems and inventory tracking systems use current technology, and are designed with our highest-volume periods in mind, which results in substantial flexibility and ample capacity in our lower-volume periods. We also subject our systems to stress and volume testing during off-peak periods to be better positioned for optimal performance during our peak season. We are investing in expanding and upgrading our information systems including our omni-channel capabilities, networks and infrastructure to provide cost effective scalability and reliability to support future growth.\n",
      "-->Pricing\n",
      "-->We offer our customers a mix of select designer-quality products and more casual items at various price points, consistent with our signature styling strategy of pairing luxury items with more casual items. We offer limited edition  collection  items such as hand-embellished sweaters and coats, Italian cashmere, limited edition prints and patterns and vintage inspired details, which we believe elevates the overall perception of our brand. We believe offering a broad range of price points maintains a more accessible, less intimidating atmosphere.\n",
      "-->Cyclicality and Seasonality\n",
      "-->Our industry is cyclical and our revenues are affected by general economic conditions. Purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and consumer confidence.\n",
      "-->Our business is seasonal and as a result, our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have four distinct selling seasons that align with our four fiscal quarters. Revenues are usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter, particularly December when customers make holiday purchases. In fiscal 2016, we realized approximately 29% of our revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter.\n",
      "-->Competition\n",
      "-->The specialty retail industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily with specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers and e-commerce businesses that engage in the sale of women s, men s and children s apparel, accessories, shoes and similar merchandise. We compete on quality, design, customer service and price. We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brands, as well as our omni-channel strategy which focuses on a seamless approach to the customer experience through all available sales channels. We believe that we also differentiate ourselves from competitors on the basis of our signature product design, our ability to offer both designer-quality products at higher price points and more casual items at lower price points, our focus on the quality of our product offerings and our customer-service oriented culture. We believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to originate, define and communicate product and fashion trends as well as to timely anticipate, predict and react to changing consumer demands.\n",
      "-->7\n",
      "-->Associates\n",
      "-->As of January 28, 2017, we had approximately 14,500 associates, of whom approximately 5,400 were full-time associates and 9,100 were part-time associates. Approximately 1,170 of these associates are employed in our customer call center and order fulfillment operations facilities in Lynchburg, Virginia; approximately 320 of these associates work in our store distribution center in Asheville, North Carolina; and approximately 330 of these associates work in our call center in San Antonio, Texas. In addition, approximately 3,400 associates are hired on a seasonal basis in these facilities and our stores to meet demand during the peak season. None of our associates are represented by a union. We have had no labor-related work stoppages and we believe our relationship with our associates is good.\n",
      "-->Trademarks and Licensing\n",
      "-->The J.Crew and Madewell trademarks and variations thereon, such as crewcuts and J.Crew Mercantile, are registered or are subject to pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries. We believe our trademarks have significant value and we intend to continue to vigorously protect them against infringement.\n",
      "-->Government Regulation\n",
      "-->We are subject to customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, employment, data privacy, product safety and other laws, including zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers and/or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.\n",
      "-->A substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside the United States. These products are imported and are subject to U.S. customs laws, which impose tariffs as well as import quota restrictions for textiles and apparel. Some of our imported products are eligible for duty-advantaged programs. While importation of goods from foreign countries from which we buy our products may be subject to embargo by U.S. Customs authorities if shipments exceed quota limits, we closely monitor import quotas and believe we have the sourcing network to efficiently shift production to factories located in countries with available quotas. The existence of import quotas has, therefore, not had a material adverse effect on our business.\n",
      "-->Available Information\n",
      "-->We make available free of charge on our website, www.jcrew.com, copies of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically with, or otherwise furnishing it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). The reference to our website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website, and the information contained on the website is not part of this document.\n",
      "-->Copies of the reports and other information we file with the SEC may also be examined by the public without charge at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549, or at http://www.sec.gov . Copies of all or a portion of such materials can be obtained from the SEC upon payment of prescribed fees. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information.\n",

      "-->RISK FACTORS.\n",
      "-->We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our business. The following are some of the more important risk factors that could affect our business.\n",
      "-->Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n",
      "-->If we are unable to predict fashion trends or react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales will decrease.\n",
      "-->We believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to:\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->originate and define product and fashion trends,\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->anticipate, predict and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner, and\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->translate market trends into desirable, saleable products far in advance of their offerings in our stores, on our websites, and in our catalogs.\n",
      "-->Because we enter into agreements for the manufacture and purchase of merchandise well in advance of the season in which merchandise will be sold, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer demand, pricing shifts and suboptimal merchandise selection and timing of merchandise purchases. We attempt to mitigate the risks of changing fashion trends and product acceptance in part by devoting a portion of our product line to classic styles that are not significantly modified from year to year. Nevertheless, if we misjudge the market for our products or overall level of consumer demand, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for others.  Our brands  images may also suffer if customers believe we are no longer able to offer the latest fashions or if we fail to address and respond to customer feedback or complaints. The occurrence of these events, among others, could hurt our financial results and liquidity by decreasing sales. We may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory, which would further decrease our gross profits and net income.\n",
      "-->Unfavorable economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "-->Economic conditions around the world can impact our customers and affect the general business environment in which we operate and compete. Our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, consumer confidence and spending levels, employment rates, consumer credit availability, fuel and energy costs, raw materials costs, global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, taxation, the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers and changing demographic patterns.\n",
      "-->Demand for our merchandise is significantly impacted by negative trends in consumer confidence and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. Because apparel and accessories generally are discretionary purchases, consumer purchases of our products may decline during recessionary periods or when disposable income is lower. As a result, our sales, growth and profitability may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions at a regional, national or international level. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions abroad may impact our ability to meet quality and production goals.\n",
      "-->Periods of economic uncertainty or volatility make it difficult to plan, budget and forecast our business. Incorrect assumptions concerning economic trends, customer requirements, distribution models, demand forecasts, interest rate trends and availability of resources may result in our failure to accurately forecast results and to achieve forecasted results or budget targets.\n",
      "-->We believe that our current cash balance, cash flow from operations and availability under our senior secured credit facilities, provide us with sufficient liquidity. However, a decrease in liquidity of our customers and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and liquidity.\n",
      "-->The specialty retail industry is cyclical, and a decline in consumer spending on apparel and accessories could reduce our sales and profitability.\n",
      "-->The industry in which we operate is cyclical. Purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including general economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, the availability of consumer credit, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, taxation, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and demographic patterns. Because apparel and accessories generally are discretionary purchases, declines in consumer spending patterns may impact us more negatively as a specialty retailer. Therefore, we may not be able to grow revenues or increase profitability if there is a decline in consumer spending patterns or we decide to slow or alter our growth plans in anticipation of or in response to a decline in consumer spending.\n",
      "-->9\n",
      "-->We operate in the highly competitive specialty retail industry, and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, which could result in loss of our market share.\n",
      "-->We face intense competition in the specialty retail industry. We compete primarily with specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers and e-commerce businesses that engage in the sale of women s, men s and children s apparel, accessories, and similar merchandise. We compete on quality, design, customer service and price. We are not in the  fast fashion  business but it appears that an increasing number of customers are attracted to the aggressive pricing strategies of those retailers.  Many of our competitors are, and many of our potential competitors may be, larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate greater international brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. A number of our competitors are continuing to operate a more promotional business than in the past, both in-store and online.  This promotional environment has negatively impacted our revenues and gross profit and may continue to do so in the future.  In addition, consumers are increasingly seeking retail experiences which emphasize value, personalization and an omni-channel environment where the store, mobile and online shopping experience is tightly integrated.  While we are working to meet these evolving customer expectations, there can be no assurance that we will do so effectively or without incurring substantial expense, which could impact our results of operations and liquidity.\n",
      "-->We rely on the experience and skills of key personnel, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n",
      "-->We believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and strategic guidance of our chief executive officer and other key executives, who are primarily responsible for executing our strategy. The loss, for any reason, of the services of any of these individuals and any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our key executives have substantial experience and expertise in the specialty retail industry and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. The unexpected loss of one or more of these individuals could delay the development and introduction of, and harm our ability to sell, our merchandise. In addition, products we develop without the guidance and direction of these key personnel may not receive the same level of acceptance.\n",
      "-->Our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for this experienced talent is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future.\n",
      "-->Our expanded product offerings, new sales channels, new brands and concepts and international expansion may not be successful, and implementation of these strategies may divert our operational, managerial, financial and administrative resources, which could impact our competitive position.\n",
      "-->We have grown our business in recent years by expanding our product offerings and sales channels, including by marketing our Madewell brand of women s apparel and accessories and launching J.Crew Mercantile. We have opened stores in Canada, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and France and expanded our international e-commerce business. In fiscal 2015, we launched our J.Crew Mercantile store concept, which are located in traditionally full price retail malls and hybrid centers, and therefore make our factory assortment more accessible to customers. These strategies to expand new brands and concepts and to expand internationally involve various risks discussed elsewhere in these risk factors, including:\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->implementation may be delayed or may not be successful,\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->if our expanded product offerings and sales channels or our international growth efforts fail to maintain and enhance the distinctive identity of our brands, our brands  images may be diminished and our sales may decrease,\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->if customers do not respond to these brands and concepts, product offerings and sales channels as anticipated, these strategies may not be profitable on a larger scale, and\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->implementation of these plans may divert management s attention from other aspects of our business, increase costs and place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources, as well as our information systems.\n",
      "-->In addition, our new product offerings, new brands and concepts, new sales channels and international expansion may be affected by, among other things, economic, demographic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer preferences and style trends. Further rollout of these strategies could be delayed or abandoned, could cost more than anticipated and could divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could impact our competitive position and reduce our revenue and profitability.\n",
      "-->10\n",
      "-->Our growth strategy depends on the successful execution of our efforts to grow our brands, develop our omni-c hannel shopping experience and expand internationally.\n",
      "-->Our customers are seeking an omni-channel shopping experience through the integration of store and digital shopping channels.  We have implemented systems to manage our inventory efficiently across all channels and to ship merchandise from stores to customers. We have enhanced our mobile experience and we continue to explore additional capabilities to broaden our omni-channel experience, including order online and pick up in the store, and various capacity and efficiency enhancements. However, these initiatives involve significant investments in information technology systems and significant operational changes, and the rapid pace of technological change may require us to incur costs to implement new systems and platforms to provide a desirable shopping experience for our customers.  We may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our customers and might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary investments in technology to compete with our competitors. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel capabilities, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If we do not implement and expand our omni-channel initiatives successfully or we do not realize our anticipated return on these investments, then our operating results could be negatively impacted and we could fail to meet our strategic and financial goals.\n",
      "-->Our growth strategy also includes international expansion of our brands. We have stores in Canada, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and France and expanded our online presence to over 100 countries. We may open stores in additional countries in the future where brand recognition may be limited. We do not have experience operating in these regions and we will face established competition in most of these markets. Many of these countries have different operational and legal requirements, including, but not limited to, employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, product labelling, product safety, consumer protection, data privacy and local reporting requirements. Consumer tastes, sizes and trends may differ from country to country and there may be seasonal differences, which, if we do not anticipate, may result in lower sales and/or margins for our products. Our success internationally could also be adversely impacted by the global economy, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in diplomatic or trade relationships, political instability and foreign government regulation.\n",
      "-->In addition, as we continue to expand our overseas operations, we are subject to certain U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. We must use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure our associates and agents comply with these laws. If any of our associates or agents violate such laws we could become subject to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\n",
      "-->As we execute our growth strategies, we may not adequately manage the related organizational changes needed for successful execution.  In addition, we may distract key resources related to our core business as a result of the focus on growth strategies.\n",
      "-->Any material disruption of our information systems, or failure to maintain and develop our information systems, could disrupt our business and reduce our sales.\n",
      "-->We are increasingly dependent on information systems to operate our websites, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. Previously, we have experienced system interruptions which temporarily impaired our ability to capture, process and ship customer orders, and transfer product between channels. We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer  hackers  or other causes. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our systems, could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed which could especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during the holiday season result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and cause our sales to decline. In addition, if changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose customers.  We are also subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the Internet, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce sales, increase costs and damage the reputation of our brands.\n",
      "-->Management uses information systems to support decision making and to monitor business performance. We may fail to generate accurate and complete financial and operational reports essential for making decisions at various levels of management, which could lead to decisions being made that have adverse results. Failure to adopt systematic procedures to initiate change requests, test changes, document changes, and authorize changes to systems and processes prior to deployment may result in unsuccessful changes and could disrupt our business and reduce sales. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate controls such as reconciliations, segregation of duties and verification to prevent errors or incomplete information, our ability to operate our business could be limited.\n",
      "-->11\n",
      "-->Compromises of our data security could cause us to incur unexpected expenses and loss of revenues and may materially harm our reputation and business.\n",
      "-->In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store certain personal information from individuals, such as our customers and employees, and we process customer payment card and check information.  We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data compromise, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information, or that any such data compromise or access will be discovered in a timely way. Further, the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, not by us. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer system and, if successful, misappropriate personal information, payment card or check information or confidential business information of our Company. In addition, there may be non-technical issues, such as our employees, contractors or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to misappropriate such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Advances in computer and software capabilities, new tools and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach. Data privacy and information security is regulated at the international, federal and state levels, and compliance with any changes in the laws and regulations enacted by these governments will likely increase the cost of doing business.\n",
      "-->Compromise of our data security or of third parties with whom we do business, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information and delays in detecting or providing prompt notice of any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers  willingness to shop in our stores, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to litigation and additional costs and liabilities which could be material.\n",
      "-->If we fail to maintain the value of our brands and protect our trademarks, our sales are likely to decline.\n",
      "-->Our success depends on the value of the J.Crew and Madewell brands and our corporate reputation. The J.Crew and Madewell names are integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brands will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity through traditional or social media platforms. Any of these events could result in decreases in sales.\n",
      "-->The J.Crew and Madewell trademarks and variations thereon, such as crewcuts and J.Crew Mercantile, are valuable assets that are critical to our success. We intend to continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement, but we may not be successful in doing so. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our trademarks would diminish the value of our brands, which could reduce demand for our products or the prices at which we can sell our products.\n",
      "-->Our real estate strategy may not be successful, and store locations may fail to produce desired results, which could impact our competitive position and profitability.\n",
      "-->We expanded our store base by 24 net new stores in fiscal 2016. We regularly evaluate our existing store base and seek to identify opportunities, where available, to renegotiate the terms of those leases. The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to open new stores and renew our existing store leases on terms that meet our financial targets. Our ability to open new stores on schedule or at all, to renew our existing store leases on favorable terms or to operate them on a profitable basis will depend on various factors, including our ability to:\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->identify suitable markets for new stores and available store locations,\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->anticipate the impact of changing economic and demographic conditions for new and existing store locations,\n",

      "-->New stores and sto res with renewed lease terms may not produce anticipated levels of revenue even though they increase our costs. As a result, our expenses as a percentage of sales would increase and our profitability would be adversely affected.\n",
      "-->Reductions in the volume of mall traffic or closing of shopping malls as a result of unfavorable economic conditions or changing demographic patterns could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory.\n",
      "-->Most of our stores are located in shopping malls or outlet centers. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those locations. Our stores benefit from the ability of the malls   anchor  tenants, generally large department stores and other area attractions, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Unfavorable economic conditions and changes in consumer behavior, particularly in certain regions, have adversely affected mall traffic and resulted in the closing of certain anchor stores and has threatened the viability of certain commercial real estate firms which operate major shopping malls. A continuation of this trend, including failure of a large commercial landlord or continued declines in the popularity of mall shopping generally among our customers, would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory. We may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory, which would further decrease our gross profits and net income.\n",
      "-->Our inability to maintain or increase comparable company sales could cause our earnings to decline.\n",
      "-->If our future comparable company sales fail to meet expectations, our earnings could decline. In addition, our results have significantly fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. For example, in the previous three fiscal years, our quarterly comparable company sales changes have ranged from an increase of 4.4% to a decrease of 11.4%. A variety of factors affect comparable company sales, including fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, timing and level of markdowns and weather conditions.\n",
      "-->In addition, the softening apparel demand in recent years has led to a more promotional environment across the specialty retail industry, which has impacted our promotional posture and our gross margins. In addition, this promotional pricing may have a negative effect on our brands  images, which may be difficult to counteract even as the economy improves.\n",
      "-->Various regions of the country experience extreme weather patterns.  Significant amounts of snow, wind, ice, flooding and other weather elements have caused and may continue to cause a greater number of store closures or lost revenue than we have historically experienced.\n",
      "-->All of these factors may cause our comparable company sales to be materially lower than previous periods and our expectations, which could impact our ability to leverage fixed expenses, such as store rent and store asset depreciation, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n",
      "-->Interruption in our foreign sourcing operations could disrupt production, shipment or receipt of our merchandise, which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs.\n",
      "-->We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third party vendors for the manufacture of all of our products. Our products are manufactured to our specifications primarily by factories outside of the United States. We cannot control all of the various factors, which include inclement weather, natural disasters, political and financial instability, strikes, health concerns regarding infectious diseases, and acts of terrorism that might affect a manufacturer s ability to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards. Inadequate labor conditions, health or safety issues in the factories where goods are produced can negatively impact our brands reputations. Late delivery of products or delivery of products that do not meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers or delay timely delivery of merchandise to our stores for those items. These events could cause us to fail to meet customer expectations, cause our customers to cancel orders or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores, which could result in lost sales.\n",
      "-->In fiscal 2016, approximately 97% of our merchandise was sourced from foreign factories. In particular, approximately 58% of our merchandise was sourced from China and Hong Kong. Any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from Asia or elsewhere, including the imposition of additional import restrictions, could materially harm our operations. We have no long-term merchandise supply contracts, and many of our imports are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the United States from countries in Asia or elsewhere. We compete with other companies for production facilities and import quota capacity. While substantially all of our foreign purchases of our products are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars, the cost of our products may be affected by fluctuations in the value of relevant foreign currencies. Our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as political instability, economic conditions, disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices.\n",
      "-->13\n",
      "-->In addition, to the manufacturing in China, we are also engaging in growing the amount of production in other developing countries. These other countries may present greater risks than China with regards to infrastructure to support manufacturing, labor and employee relations, political and economic stability, corruption, environmental, health and safety compliance. While we endeavor to monitor and audit facilities where our production is done, any significant events with factories we use can adversely impact our reputation, brand, and product delivery.\n",
      "-->Increases in the demand for, or the price of, raw materials used to manufacture our products or other fluctuations in sourcing or distribution costs could increase our costs and hurt our profitability.\n",
      "-->The raw materials used to manufacture our products are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high demand for fabrics, weather, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other unpredictable factors. In addition, our sourcing costs may also fluctuate due to labor conditions, transportation or freight costs, energy prices, currency fluctuations or other unpredictable factors. Further, the cost of labor at many of our third party manufacturers and the cost of transportation have been increasing and it is unlikely that such cost pressures will abate.\n",
      "-->Most of our products are shipped from our vendors by ocean.  If a disruption occurs in the operation of ports through which our products are imported, we may incur increased costs related to air freight or to alternative ports.  Shipping by air is significantly more expensive than shipping by ocean and our margins and profitability could be reduced.  Shipping to alternative ports could also lead to delays in receipt of our products.\n",
      "-->We believe that we have strong vendor relationships and we are working with our suppliers to manage cost increases. Our overall profitability depends, in part, on the success of our ability to mitigate rising costs or shortages of raw materials used to manufacture our products.\n",
      "-->Any significant interruption in the operations of our customer call, order fulfillment and distribution facilities could disrupt our ability to process customer orders and to deliver our merchandise in a timely manner.\n",
      "-->A substantial portion of our e-commerce order fulfillment operations are housed in a single facility along with one of our customer call centers, while distribution operations for our stores are housed in another single facility. Although we maintain back-up systems for these facilities, we may not be able to prevent a significant interruption in our operations if one or both of these facilities were impacted by a natural disaster, accident, failure of the inventory locator or automated packing and shipping systems we use or other events. We have experienced interruptions in the past in connection with our website systems and while we have stabilized these systems, there can be no assurance that future interruptions will not occur. Any significant interruption in the operation of these facilities, including an interruption caused by our failure to successfully expand or upgrade our systems or manage our transition to utilizing the expansions or upgrades, could reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores and customers, which could result in lost sales, cancelled sales and a loss of loyalty to our brand.\n",
      "-->Third party failure to deliver merchandise to our distribution centers, stores and customers or a disruption or adverse condition affecting our distribution centers could result in lost sales or reduced demand for our merchandise.\n",
      "-->Our success depends on the timely receipt of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers, and timely delivery of merchandise from our distribution facilities to stores and customers. Independent third party transportation companies deliver our merchandise to our distribution centers, stores and customers. Some of these third parties employ personnel represented by labor unions. Disruptions in the delivery of merchandise or work stoppages by employees of these third parties could delay the timely receipt of merchandise, which could result in cancelled sales, a loss of loyalty to our brands, increased logistics costs and excess inventory.\n",
      "-->We currently operate two of our own distribution centers in North Carolina and Virginia. Timely receipt of merchandise by our distribution centers, stores and customers may also be affected by factors such as inclement weather, natural disasters, accidents, system failures and acts of terrorism. We may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions, which would decrease our gross profits and net income. Inability to recover from a business interruption and return to normal operations within a reasonable period of time could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and damage our brand reputation.\n",
      "-->14\n",
      "-->Our ability to source our merchandise profitably or at all could be hurt if new trade restrictions are imposed, existing trade restrictions become more burdensome or disruption occur at our suppliers or at the ports.\n",
      "-->Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs, safeguards or quotas, on apparel and accessories could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us. We source our merchandise through buying agents and by purchasing directly from trading companies and manufacturers, predominately in Asia. There are quotas and trade restrictions on certain categories of goods and apparel from China and countries that are not subject to the World Trade Organization Agreement, which could have a significant impact on our sourcing patterns in the future. In addition, during, and following, the recent presidential election in the United States, there was discussion and commentary regarding potential significant changes to United States trade policies, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs regarding China where a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports was specifically discussed as well as a disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products. The results of the presidential election have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and countries in Asia. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity, restrict our sourcing from suppliers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and affect our strategy in the Asia and elsewhere around the world. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise is currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. and foreign governments, nor can we predict the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions against apparel items could increase the cost, delay shipping or reduce the supply of apparel available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices, any of which could hurt our profitability.\n",
      "-->We rely on our suppliers to manufacture and ship the products they produce for us in a timely manner.  We also rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide. Labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers could increase costs for us and delay our receipt of merchandise, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions.\n",
      "-->If our independent manufacturers do not use ethical business practices or comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brands could be harmed due to negative publicity.\n",
      "-->While our internal and vendor operating guidelines, as outlined in our Vendor Code of Conduct, promote ethical business practices and we, along with third parties that we retain for this purpose, monitor compliance with those guidelines, we do not control our independent manufacturers. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with our guidelines. Our Vendor Code of Conduct is designed to ensure that each of our suppliers  operations is conducted in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner. Our Vendor Code of Conduct requires that each of our suppliers operates in compliance with applicable wage benefit, working hours and other local laws, and forbids the use of practices such as child labor or forced labor.\n",
      "-->Violation of labor or other laws by our independent manufacturers, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer s practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States could diminish the value of the J.Crew and Madewell brands and reduce demand for our merchandise if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract negative publicity.\n",
      "-->We are subject to customs, advertising, consumer protection, data privacy, product safety, zoning and occupancy and labor and employment laws that could require us to modify our current business practices, incur increased costs or harm our reputation if we do not comply.\n",
      "-->We are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, general data privacy, health information privacy, identity theft, online privacy, product safety, unsolicited commercial communication and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. If these regulations were to change or were violated by our management, associates, suppliers, buying agents or trading companies, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and hurt our business and results of operations. Failure to protect personally identifiable information of our customers or associates could subject us to considerable reputational harm as well as significant fines, penalties and sanctions. In addition, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs, which could hurt our profitability.\n",
      "-->15\n",
      "-->Legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost o f compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. Failure to define clear roles and responsibilities or to regularly communicate with and train our associates may result in noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business. We expect the costs of compliance and risks to our business in this area to increase a s we expand our international and e-commerce business.\n",
      "-->Our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n",
      "-->Our international revenues are a small percentage of our business that may increase as we expand internationally. As a result, our future revenues and results of operations could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Revenues and certain expenses in markets outside the United States are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into U.S. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements.  In addition, our international subsidiaries transact in currencies other than their functional currency, primarily in respect of inventory purchases denominated in U.S. dollars, which could result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Finally, our vendors and suppliers may also be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to the purchase of fabric and other raw materials.\n",
      "-->Fluctuations in our results of operations for the fourth fiscal quarter would have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "-->Our revenues are generally lower during the first and second fiscal quarters. In addition, any factors that harm our fourth fiscal quarter operating results, including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.\n",
      "-->In order to prepare for our peak shopping season, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry at other times of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak shopping season could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and gross profit. Additional unplanned decreases in demand for our products could produce further reductions to our net sales and gross profit.\n",
      "-->Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of new store openings and of catalog mailings and the revenues contributed by new stores, merchandise mix and the timing and level of inventory markdowns. As a result, historical period-to-period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future period-to-period results.\n",
      "-->We have recognized substantial goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses in the past and may be required to recognize additional non-cash impairment losses in the future.\n",
      "-->Certain factors, including consumer spending levels, industry and macroeconomic conditions, and the future profitability of our businesses, might have a negative impact on the carrying value of our goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets. We could experience material impairment losses in the future. For example, during fiscal 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $1,382 million related to goodwill allocated to our J.Crew reporting unit, the intangible asset for our J.Crew trade name and certain long-lived assets. Although an impairment charge would be a non-cash expense, any impairment charges could materially increase our expenses and reduce our profitability. The process of testing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment involves numerous judgments, assumptions and estimates made by management including expected future profitability, cash flows and the fair values of assets and liabilities, which inherently reflect a high degree of uncertainty and may be affected by significant variability.  If the business climate deteriorates, then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments, assumptions and estimates, and our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods.  This would in turn have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n",
      "-->16\n",
      "-->We may be a party to legal proceedings in the f uture that could adversely affect our business.\n",
      "-->From time to time, like others in the retail industry, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property, consumer protection, consumer accessibility and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, there are an increasing number of cases being filed in the retail industry, including those that we have been subject to or may be subject to in the future, that contain class and representative action allegations, such as those relating to data privacy and wage and hour laws. We evaluate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish reserves for the estimated liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. Although not currently anticipated by management, unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in management s evaluations or predictions and accompanying changes in established reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\n",
      "-->We could be subject to changes in our tax rates and the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposed to additional tax liabilities in connection with our international operations, which could negatively impact our financial results.\n",
      "-->We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where our international subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S.\n",
      "-->We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S., or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, then our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n",
      "-->Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Certain Other Obligations\n",
      "-->Our substantial indebtedness and lease obligations could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and make strategic investments, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\n",
      "-->We are highly leveraged. The total indebtedness of J.Crew and its subsidiaries at January 28, 2017 was $1,528 million, consisting of borrowings under our term loan credit facility, as amended and restated on March 5, 2014 (the  Term Loan Facility ). We can also borrow up to $350 million under our senior secured asset-based revolving line of credit, dated as of March 7, 2011 (as amended through and including November 17, 2016, the  ABL Facility , and together with our Term Loan Facility, the  Senior Credit Facilities ), subject to a borrowing base limitation. As of January 28, 2017, our Senior Credit Facilities also allowed uncommitted incremental facilities in an aggregate amount of $300 million consisting of $200 million available as incremental term loan facilities and $100 million available as increased commitments under our ABL Facility. Additional incremental term loan facilities are permitted subject to our meeting certain conditions, including a pro forma total senior secured leverage ratio of less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.00.\n",
      "-->On November 4, 2013, Chinos Intermediate Holdings A, Inc. (the  Issuer ), an indirect parent holding company of Group, issued $500 million aggregate principal of 7.75/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due May 1, 2019 (the  PIK Notes ).  The PIK Notes are (i) senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Issuer s subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the Issuer s subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in our financial statements.\n",
      "-->During fiscal 2016, the Issuer made interest payments on the PIK Notes by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. On October 28, 2016, the Issuer also delivered notice to U.S. Bank N.A., as trustee, under the indenture governing the PIK Notes, that with respect to the interest that will be due on such notes on the May 1, 2017 interest payment date, the Issuer will make such interest payment by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. The PIK election will increase the outstanding principal balance of the PIK Notes by $23.1 million to $566.5 million. Therefore, we will not pay a dividend to the Issuer in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to fund a semi-annual interest payment. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the PIK Notes, the Issuer intends to evaluate this option prior to the beginning of each interest period based on relevant factors at that time.\n",
      "-->17\n",
      "-->We and our subsidiaries, affiliates, Parent, Sponsors or affiliates of our Sponsors may from time to tim e seek to retire or purchase, directly or indirectly, our outstanding indebtedness, including the PIK Notes, through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such purchases and/or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, which could impact our capital structure, the market for our debt securities, t he price of the indebtedness being purchased and/or exchanged and affect our liquidity.\n",
      "-->We also have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations. As of January 28, 2017, our minimum annual rental obligations under long-term operating leases for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 are $190 million and $171 million, respectively.\n",
      "-->Our high degree of leverage and significant lease obligations could have important consequences for our creditors. For example, they could:\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital (including vendor payment terms), capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n",
      "--> \n",

      "--> \n",
      "-->increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->require a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness (including any dividends to the Issuer to fund interest payments), thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future strategic initiatives.\n",
      "-->We expect to pay interest of approximately $80 million in fiscal 2017, excluding any payments of dividends, if any, to the Issuer to fund debt service obligations.\n",
      "-->Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\n",
      "-->The Senior Credit Facilities contain various covenants that limit the ability of J.Crew and our other subsidiaries to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability and the ability of J.Crew, Chinos Intermediate Holdings B, Inc. ( Intermediate Holdings B ) and our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n",
      "--> \n",

      "--> \n",
      "-->sell or otherwise transfer assets.\n",
      "-->In addition, under our Senior Credit Facilities, we are required to meet specified financial ratios in order to undertake certain actions, and under the ABL Facility in certain circumstances, we may be required to maintain certain levels of excess availability or meet a specified fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to meet those tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. A breach of any of these covenants in any Senior Credit Facility could result in a default under such Senior Credit Facility and, in some cases, the other Senior Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Credit Facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such Senior Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the applicable Senior Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Intermediate Holdings B, J.Crew and certain of J.Crew s subsidiaries have pledged substantially all of their assets, including, in the case of Intermediate Holdings B, a pledge of the capital stock of J.Crew, as collateral under the Senior Credit Facilities. If the lenders under any Senior Secured Credit Facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that Senior Credit Facility, as well as our other secured and unsecured indebtedness.\n",
      "-->18\n",
      "-->To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\n",
      "-->Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow in the future. This ability is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\n",
      "-->Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available under our Senior Credit Facilities, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In any such circumstance, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our Senior Credit Facilities, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Any such action, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facilities contain restrictions on our ability to sell certain assets and limit the use of the proceeds from such sales.\n",
      "-->If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including covenants in our Senior Credit Facilities), we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we breach our covenants under the credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facilities and are required to seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders on acceptable terms, or at all. If this occurs, we would be in default under our Senior Credit Facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\n",
      "-->Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\n",
      "-->Borrowings pursuant to our Term Loan Facility bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR, but in no event less than the floor rate of 1.00%, plus the applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense which will in turn, increase or decrease our net income and cash flow. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness by entering into interest rate swaps . While limiting exposure to interest rate increases, these instruments may not fully mitigate our risk or may not be effective. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see note 8 in the consolidated financial statements.\n",
      "-->Actions we are taking to decrease our substantial leverage and strengthen our financial position may not be successful.\n",
      "-->On December 5, 2016, we designated certain newly formed subsidiaries as  Unrestricted Subsidiaries  and transferred certain domestic intellectual property assets to these Unrestricted Subsidiaries for the purpose of providing us flexibility in connection with evaluating our capital structure. We are exploring various possible transactions that could involve such transferred intellectual property assets.  While we and the Issuer have entered into discussions with certain holders of the PIK Notes and their advisors to explore potential transactions, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach any agreement with any holders that will reduce the principal amount or extend the maturity date of the PIK Notes outstanding or that we will decide to proceed with this transaction, a different transaction or any transaction at all. For example, an ad hoc group of lenders under the Term Loan Facility has been formed and has taken action to appoint a successor agent under the Term Loan Facility. While we have filed a complaint asserting that any attempt by the successor agent or the ad hoc group of lenders under the Term Loan Facility to challenge our actions is improper, and seeking a declaration that our actions with respect to the transfer of the intellectual property assets are in full compliance with the terms of our Term Loan Facility, there is no guarantee that we will be successful. Our failure to enter into a refinancing or liability management transaction involving the PIK Notes may have a material adverse effect on the Issuer s ability to pay the PIK Notes on the maturity date and therefore on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

      "-->Our J.Crew brand is headquartered in New York, NY, where our corporate office is leased under a lease agreement expiring in 2022, with an option to renew thereafter. Our Madewell brand is headquartered in Long Island City, NY, where our corporate office is leased under a lease agreement expiring in 2027, with an option to renew thereafter. We own three facilities: (i) a 425,000 square foot customer call center, order fulfillment and distribution center in Lynchburg, Virginia, (ii) a 282,000 square foot distribution center in Asheville, North Carolina and (iii) a 63,700 square foot facility in Lynchburg, Virginia. In fiscal 2016, we commenced discussions regarding sale-lease back transactions of our distribution facilities. We also lease a 45,800 square foot customer call center in San Antonio, Texas under a lease agreement expiring in October 2021. We also lease small corporate office spaces in the United States and internationally.\n",
      "-->As of January 28, 2017, we operated 281 J.Crew retail stores, 181 J.Crew factory stores (including 39 J.Crew Mercantile stores), and 113 Madewell stores in 44 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and France. All of our stores are leased from third parties with terms, in most cases, of 5 to 10 years. A portion of our leases have options to renew for a period of 5 years. Generally, the leases contain standard provisions concerning the payment of rent, events of default and the rights and obligations of each party. Rent due under the leases is generally comprised of annual base rent plus a contingent rent payment based on the store s sales in excess of a specified threshold. Some of the leases also contain early termination options, which can be exercised by us or the landlord under certain conditions. The leases also generally require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and certain common area costs. We renegotiate with landlords to obtain more favorable terms as opportunities arise. We consider these properties to be in good condition and believe that our facilities are adequate for operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated future requirements.\n",

Management does not expect that the results of any of these legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of January 28, 2017, we have recorded a reserve for certain legal contingencies in connection with ongoing claims and litigation. The reserve is not material to our results of operations. In addition, there are certain other claims and legal proceedings pending against us for which accruals have not been established.\n",

      "-->On November 4, 2013 the Issuer, our indirect parent holding company, issued $500 million aggregate principal of the PIK Notes. The net proceeds of $490 million from this offering were used by the Issuer to fund a cash dividend of $484 million to equity holders. The PIK Notes are: (i) senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Issuers  subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the Issuers  subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in our financial statements.\n",
      "-->In fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, we paid dividends of $28 million and $38 million, respectively, to the Issuer to fund the semi-annual interest payments. During fiscal 2016, the Issuer made interest payments on the PIK Notes by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. On October 28, 2016, the Issuer also delivered notice to U.S. Bank N.A., as trustee, under the indenture governing the PIK Notes, that with respect to the interest that will be due on such notes on the May 1, 2017 interest payment date, the Issuer will make such interest payment by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. The PIK election will increase the outstanding principal balance of the PIK Notes by $23.1 million to $566.5 million. Therefore, we will not pay a dividend to the Issuer in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to fund a semi-annual interest payment. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the PIK Notes, the Issuer intends to evaluate this option prior to the beginning of each interest period based on relevant factors at that time.\n",

      "-->26\n",
      "-->Cyclicality and Seasonality\n",
      "-->Our industry is cyclical and our revenues are affected by general economic conditions. Purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and consumer confidence.\n",
      "-->Our business is seasonal and as a result, our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have four distinct selling seasons that align with our four fiscal quarters. Revenues are usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter, particularly in December when customers make holiday purchases. In fiscal 2016, we realized approximately 29% of our revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter.\n",
      "-->Gross Profit\n",
      "-->Gross profit is determined by subtracting our cost of goods sold from our revenues. Cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, freight, design, buying and production costs, occupancy costs related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and all shipping costs associated with our e-commerce business. Cost of goods sold varies directly with revenues, and therefore, is usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter. Cost of goods sold also changes as we expand or contract our store base and incur higher or lower store occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our revenues.\n",
      "-->Our gross profit may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold while others, like us, exclude all or a portion of them from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n",
      "-->Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n",
      "-->Selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating expenses not included in cost of goods sold, primarily catalog production and mailing costs, certain warehousing expenses, administrative payroll, store expenses other than occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, and credit card fees. These expenses do not necessarily vary proportionally with net sales.\n",

The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate in each fiscal year was driven primarily by the non-cash impairment charges related to the write off of goodwill, which is not tax deductible, and therefore has no tax benefit. Other items impacting the effective rates include state and local income taxes, benefits of lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, offset by the recognition of certain foreign valuation allowances.\n",

This increase was due to: (i) an increase in impairment losses of $671.6 million, (ii) a decrease in gross profit of $75.3 million, offset by (iii) an increase in the benefit for income taxes of $86.7 million, (iv) a loss on refinancing in the prior year of $59.0 million, (v) a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $11.9 million and (vi) a decrease in interest expense of $4.6 million.\n",

The borrowing base under the ABL Facility equals the sum of: 90% of the eligible credit card receivables; plus, 85% of eligible accounts; plus, 90% (or 92.5% for the period of August 1 through December 31 of any fiscal year) of the net recovery percentage of eligible inventory multiplied by the cost of eligible inventory; plus 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible letters of credit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible letter of credit inventory; plus, 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible in-transit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible in-transit inventory; plus, 100% of qualified cash; minus, all availability and inventory reserves. The ABL Facility includes borrowing capacity in the form of letters of credit up to $200 million, and up to $25 million in U.S. dollars for loans on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, and is available in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. Any amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are due and payable in full on the maturity date.

      "-->During fiscal 2016, the Issuer made interest payments on the PIK notes by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash.

The PIK election will increase the outstanding principal balance of the PIK Notes by $23.1 million to $566.5 million. Therefore, we will not pay a dividend to the Issuer in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to fund a semi-annual interest payment. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the PIK Notes, the Issuer intends to evaluate this option prior to the beginning of each interest period based on relevant factors at that time.\n",

Crew International entered into an intellectual property license agreement (the  Transferred IP License Agreement ) pursuant to which we and our subsidiaries will continue to have exclusive rights to use the Transferred IP. Future payments under the Transferred IP License Agreement will be fixed in the future and on terms no less favorable than could be obtained in an arm s length transaction with an unaffiliated third party.

      "-->Short-term and long-term liquidity needs of J.Crew Group, Inc. arise primarily from (i) capital expenditures, (ii) debt service requirements, including required (a) quarterly principal repayments, (b) repayments, if any, based on annual excess cash flows, if any, as defined and (c) dividends to the Issuer, when required, for the purposes of servicing debt, and (iii) working capital. Management anticipates that capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 will be approximately $50 to $60 million, including $30 to $35 million for information technology enhancements, $10 to $15 million for new stores and the remainder for warehouse improvements, store renovations and general corporate purposes. Management expects to pay interest of approximately $80 million in fiscal 2017 to fund debt service obligations, excluding payments of dividends, if any, to the Issuer. Management believes that our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, projected cash flow from operations and amounts available under the ABL Facility will be adequate to fund primary short-term and long-term liquidity needs of J.Crew Group, Inc., subject to considerations described further below. Our ability to satisfy these obligations and to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our financing arrangements depends on our future operating performance, which in turn, may be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. See Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in part I of this report.\n",
      "-->To address any potential liquidity issue of the Issuer arising as a result of the PIK Notes maturity in 2019, we are currently working to refinance the PIK notes or enter into a liability management transaction involving the PIK Notes.  As such, we or the Issuer may seek to retire or purchase, directly or indirectly, our outstanding indebtedness, and/or the PIK Notes, through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, which could impact our or the Issuer s capital structure, the market for our or the Issuer s debt securities, the price of the indebtedness being purchased and/or exchanged and affect our or the Issuer s liquidity. For example, we have entered into discussions with certain holders of the PIK Notes and their advisors to explore potential transactions, but there is no guarantee that we will reach any agreement with any holders that will reduce the principal amount or extend the maturity date of the PIK Notes outstanding or that we will decide to proceed with this transaction, a different transaction or any transaction at all.

The PIK Notes are: (i) senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Issuers  subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the Issuers  subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in our financial statements. On October 28, 2016, the Issuer delivered notice to U.S. Bank N.A., as trustee, under the indenture governing the PIK Notes, that with respect to the interest that will be due on such notes on the May 1, 2017 interest payment date, the Issuer will make such interest payment by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. The PIK election will increase the outstanding principal balance of the PIK Notes by $23.1 million to $566.5 million. Therefore, we will not pay a dividend to the Issuer in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to fund a semi-annual interest payment. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the PIK Notes, the Issuer intends to evaluate this option prior to the beginning of each interest period based on relevant factors at that time.\n",

      "-->Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n",

The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of the n ew pronouncement is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement s.\n",
      "-->In February 2016, a pronouncement was issued that requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with accounting lease terms of more than 12 months. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements. However, the adoption is expected to have a significant impact because most of our leases will be subject to these new requirements.\n",
      "-->In August 2016, a pronouncement was issued which aims to reduce the diversity in presentation and classification of the following specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration, insurance proceeds, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interest in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\n",
      "-->In January 2017, a pronouncement was issued that simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by no longer requiring an entity to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Instead, impairment will be measured using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\n",
      "-->Critical Accounting Policies\n",
      "-->Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n",
      "-->The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent consolidated results of operations. For more information on our accounting policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n",
      "-->Revenue Recognition\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->We recognize sales made in our stores at the point of sale, and sales through our e-commerce business at an estimated date of receipt by the customer. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling sales are classified as other revenues. We make estimates of future sales returns related to current period sales. Management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns.\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue.\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->We account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold and recognizing revenue at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. We review our gift card liability on an ongoing basis and recognize income from unredeemed gift card liability on a ratable basis over the estimated period of redemption. We defer revenue and recognize a liability for gift cards issued in connection with our customer loyalty program. Any unredeemed loyalty gift cards are recognized as income in the period in which they expire.\n",
      "-->39\n",
      "-->Inventory Valuation\n",
      "-->Merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value. We capitalize certain design, purchasing and warehousing costs in inventory. We evaluate all of our inventories to determine excess inventories based on estimated future sales. Excess inventories may be disposed of through our e-commerce business, factory stores and other liquidation methods. Based on historical results experienced through various methods of disposition, we write down the carrying value of inventories that are not expected to be sold at or above cost. Additionally, we reduce the cost of inventories based on an estimate of lost or stolen items each period.\n",
      "-->Deferred Catalog Costs\n",
      "-->The costs associated with direct response advertising, which consist primarily of catalog production and mailing costs, are capitalized and amortized over the expected future revenue stream of the catalog mailings, which we currently estimate to be two months. The expected future revenue stream is determined based on historical revenue trends developed over an extended period of time. If the current revenue streams were to diverge from the expected trend, our amortization of deferred catalog costs would be adjusted accordingly.\n",
      "-->Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n",
      "-->Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the J.Crew trade name and goodwill, are not subject to amortization. The Company assesses the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangibles whenever there are indicators of impairment, or at least annually in the fourth quarter. If the recorded carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company records a charge to write the intangible asset down to its fair value. Definite-lived intangibles, such as the Madewell trade name and favorable lease commitments, are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful life or remaining lease term.\n",
      "-->We assess the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, which consists of our operating segments, J.Crew and Madewell, of which only Madewell has goodwill. In this assessment, we first compare the estimated enterprise fair value of the Madewell reporting unit to its recorded carrying value. We estimate the enterprise fair value based on a combination of an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow, a market approach, and a transaction approach. If the recorded carrying value of the Madewell reporting unit exceeds its estimated enterprise fair value in the first step, a second step is performed in which we allocate the enterprise fair value to the fair value of Madewell s net assets. The second step of the impairment testing process requires, among other things, estimates of fair values of substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. Any enterprise fair value in excess of amounts allocated to such net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill for Madewell. If the recorded goodwill balance for Madewell exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write goodwill down to its fair value.\n",
      "-->Fixed Asset Impairment\n",
      "-->We are exposed to potential impairment if the book value of our assets exceeds their expected undiscounted future cash flows. The major components of our long-lived assets are store fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements. We test for impairment at the store level and the net book value is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected discounted future net cash flows is less than net book value.\n",
      "-->In fiscal 2016, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $7.8 million related to certain long-lived assets.\n",
      "-->Income Taxes\n",
      "-->An asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred taxes are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred taxes are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance.\n",
      "-->We maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.\n",
      "-->40\n",
      "-->With respect to uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return, we recognize in our financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a  more likely than not  threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain positions are measured based on the largest benefit t hat has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement.\n",
      "-->It is our intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings and profits from our foreign operations that have been generated through January 28, 2017. Future plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the foreign amounts to fund U.S. operations. Cumulative undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries were $69.8 million at January 28, 2017. No deferred federal income taxes were provided for the undistributed earnings as they are permanently reinvested in our international operations. Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was $21.4 million, valued in U.S. dollars, at January 28, 2017.\n",
      "-->Share-Based Compensation\n",
      "-->The fair value of employee share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense in the statement of operations. Determining the fair value of options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility and the expected dividend yield. Upon grant of awards, we also estimate an amount of forfeitures that will occur prior to vesting. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from the estimates, share-based compensation expense could be materially impacted.\n",
      "-->Foreign Currency Translation\n",
      "-->The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars.  Assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, equity accounts at historical exchange rates, while revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income, but are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders  equity (deficit).\n",
      "-->Derivative Financial Instruments\n",
      "-->We entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness. As cash flow hedges, unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. The interest rate swap agreements are highly correlated to the changes in interest rates to which we are exposed. Unrealized gains and losses on this instrument are designated as effective or ineffective. The effective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, while the ineffective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of interest expense. Realized gains and losses in connection with each required interest payment are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.\n",

      "-->QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\n",
      "-->Interest Rates\n",
      "-->We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates on the floating rate indebtedness under our Senior Credit Facilities. Borrowings pursuant to our Term Loan Facility bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR, but in no event less than the floor rate of 1.00%, plus the applicable margin. Borrowings pursuant to our ABL Facility bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR and the prime rate, plus the applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense which will in turn, increase or decrease our net income and cash flow.\n",
      "-->We manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness by entering into interest rate swaps whereby we receive floating rate payments based on the greater of LIBOR and the floor rate and make payments based on a fixed rate. Our interest rate swap agreements cover a notional amount of $800 million from March 2016 to March 2019. Under the terms of these agreements, our effective fixed interest rate on the notional amount of indebtedness is 2.56% plus the applicable margin.\n",
      "-->As a result of the floor rate described above, we estimate that a 1% increase in LIBOR would increase our annual interest expense by $7 million.\n",
      "-->41\n",
      "-->Foreign Currency\n",
      "-->Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency.  Although our inventory is primarily purchased from foreign vendors, such purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars; and are therefore not subject to foreign currency exchange risk. However, we operate in foreign countries, which exposes the Company to market risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations. The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from its foreign operating subsidiaries  U.S. dollar denominated transactions.\n",

Our compensation committee (the  Committee ) consists of representatives from our Sponsors and Mr. Squeri. The following is a discussion of the current compensation philosophy and programs applicable to our executive officers in fiscal 2016.\n",
      "-->Fiscal 2016 Compensation Philosophy and Compensation Program Objectives\n",
      "-->We place high value on attracting and retaining our executives and associates since their talent and performance are essential to our long-term success. Our compensation philosophy places high value on performance-based and discretionary compensation. Accordingly, our compensation program is designed to be both competitive and fiscally responsible and seeks to:\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->attract the highest caliber of talent required for the success of our business,\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->retain those associates capable of achieving challenging performance standards,\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->incent associates to strive for superior Company and individual performance,\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->align the interests of our executives with the financial and strategic objectives of our Sponsors, and\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->encourage and reward the achievement of our short- and long-term goals and operating plans.\n",
      "-->We seek to achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program by offering a compensation package that utilizes three key elements: (1) base salary, (2) annual cash incentives, and (3) long-term incentives. We believe that together these elements support the objectives of our compensation program without encouraging unnecessary or excessive risk taking on the part of the Company s associates.\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->Base Salaries . We seek to provide competitive base salaries factoring in the responsibilities associated with the executive s position, the executive s skills and experience, and the executive s performance as well as other factors. We believe appropriate base salary levels are critical in helping us attract and retain talented associates.\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->Annual Cash Incentives. The aim of this element of compensation is to reward individual and group contributions to the Company s annual operating performance based upon the achievement of pre-established performance standards in the most recent completed fiscal year.\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->Long-Term Incentives. The long-term element of our compensation program consists of the opportunity for our executive officers to participate directly as equity owners of the Company through the roll-over and purchase of Parent shares and grants of stock options to purchase Parent shares. The equity component is the most significant element of our executive compensation program because we believe that a meaningful equity interest by our executive officers and management team will provide a strong incentive to drive top line growth, increase margins and profitability and pursue growth opportunities, which we believe will lead to increased equity value and returns to investors.  In fiscal 2016, in order to maintain the incentive value of stock option awards currently outstanding, we offered all eligible employees, including the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Nicholson), and Mr. Squeri, the opportunity to exchange their outstanding stock option awards for awards with a lower per-share exercise price and, in the case of time-based vesting stock options, an extended vesting schedule (the  stock option re-pricing ).\n",

      "-->The Fiscal 2016 Executive Compensation Process\n",
      "-->The Compensation Committee\n",
      "-->The Committee oversees our executive compensation program. The Committee meets regularly, both with and without management. The Committee s responsibilities are detailed in its charter, which can be found on the investor relations section of our website at www.jcrew.com. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->reviewing and approving our compensation philosophy,\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->determining executive compensation levels,\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->annually reviewing and assessing performance goals and objectives for all executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), and\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->determining short-term and long-term incentive compensation for all executive officers, including the CEO.\n",
      "-->The Committee is responsible for making all decisions with respect to the compensation of the executive officers. With respect to the executive officers other than the CEO, the Committee s compensation decisions involve the review of recommendations made by our CEO and Executive Vice President of Human Resources ( EVP HR ). The CEO and EVP HR attend the Committee s meetings and provide input to the Committee regarding the effectiveness of the compensation program in attracting and retaining key talent. They make recommendations to the Committee regarding executive merit increases, short-term and long-term incentive awards and compensation packages for executives being hired or promoted. The Committee also considers the CEO s evaluation of the performance of the executive officers (other than himself), each of whom report to him.\n",
      "-->The compensation of the CEO is determined by the Committee independently of management. The Committee makes decisions about the CEO s compensation during executive session outside the presence of the CEO. Annually, outside directors of the Board evaluate the performance of the CEO and that evaluation is then communicated to the CEO by the Chairman of the Committee.\n",
      "-->The Committee s process for determining executive compensation is straightforward. In the first quarter of each fiscal year, the Committee s primary focus is to review base salaries, determine payout amounts for annual cash incentives in respect of the prior fiscal year for the executive officers, and review long-term equity for the senior officers and certain other key associates. At this time, the Committee also generally reviews and establishes performance metrics for the current fiscal year s annual cash incentive plan.\n",
      "-->The Committee considers both external and internal factors when making decisions about executive compensation. External factors include the competitiveness of each element of our compensation program relative to peer companies and the market demand for executives with specific skills or experience in the specialty apparel industry. Internal factors include an executive s level of responsibility, level of performance, long-term potential and previous levels of compensation, including outstanding equity awards. While all of these factors provide useful data points in setting compensation levels, we take into account the fact that external data typically reflects pay decisions made during a prior year. We also consider the state of the overall retail industry, the economy and general business conditions.\n",
      "-->Outside Compensation Consultant\n",
      "-->No independent executive compensation consultants were retained by the Committee during fiscal 2016.\n",
      "-->Benchmarking Process\n",
      "-->In making compensation decisions for fiscal 2016, the Committee considered the competitive market for executives and compensation levels provided by comparable companies. The comparative group used to benchmark compensation with respect to our executive officers and other key associates is composed of specialty retailers with highly visible brands that we view as competitors for customers and/or executive talent. For fiscal 2016, the peer companies were Abercrombie & Fitch Co., American Eagle Outfitters, Inc., Ascena Retail Group, Inc., Chico s FAS, Inc., Coach, Inc., The Gap, Inc., Guess, Inc., Kate Spade & Company, L Brands, Inc., Michael Kors Holdings Ltd., Nordstrom, Inc., Ralph Lauren Corp., Under Armour, Inc. and Urban Outfitters, Inc. In addition, we monitor the marketplace for innovative and creative compensation programs of those companies that we view as leading their industry. Though the Company generally targets salary levels at the median of our peer group, total compensation may exceed or fall below the median for certain of our executive officers and other key associates since one of the objectives of our compensation program is to consistently reward and retain top performers and to differentiate compensation based upon individual and Company performance.\n",
      "-->We also consider compensation survey data from surveys in which we participate or purchase from a variety of publishers which may incorporate data from other industries.\n",
      "-->47\n",
      "-->CEO Compensation\n",
      "-->At the time Mr. Drexler joined the Company in 2003, he invested $10 million of his own funds to purchase a substantial equity ownership interest in the Company. He also paid us $1 million as consideration for a grant of stock options and a grant of restricted stock. His annual base salary was set at $200,000 in 2003 and has not increased.\n",
      "-->In connection with the Acquisition, Mr. Drexler contributed an aggregate amount of 2,287,545 shares worth approximately $99.5 million in exchange for an ownership interest in Parent following the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, in accordance with his new employment agreement, Mr. Drexler was awarded 32,109,219 non-qualified stock options, a portion of which vest over time and a portion of which are subject to performance-based vesting conditions.  In 2013, Mr. Drexler acquired an additional 12,040,957 shares in Parent through the exercise of a portion of these stock options.  In 2016, Mr. Drexler participated in the stock option re-pricing, and exchanged 12,040,957 of his fully vested time-vesting stock options with an exercise price of $0.25 per share for stock options with an exercise price of $0.10 per share, of which 6,020,479 remained fully vested and 6,020,478 became subject to an additional 4 year time-based vesting period.  He also exchanged 8,027,305 performance-vesting stock options with an exercise price of $0.25 per share for stock options with an exercise price of $0.10 per share and the same performance-vesting hurdles.\n",
      "-->Mr. Drexler s substantial investment in the Company and the size of his equity incentive awards are consistent with his role as an owner-manager and are designed to ensure his commitment to the long-term future of the Company. Details regarding Mr. Drexler s compensation package are contained in tables that follow. In addition, a description of his employment agreement, originally entered into in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, is contained in a section that follows. We intend to continue to evaluate the components and level of our CEO s compensation on an ongoing basis.\n",
      "-->Components of the Executive Compensation Program\n",
      "-->We believe that a substantial portion of executive compensation should be performance-based. We also believe it is essential for executives to have a meaningful equity stake linked to the long-term performance of the Company; therefore, we have created compensation packages that aim to foster an owner-operator culture. As such, other than base salary, compensation of our executive officers is largely comprised of variable or  at-risk  incentive pay linked to the Company s financial performance and individual contributions. Other factors we consider in evaluating executive compensation include internal pay equity, external market and competitive information, assessment of individual performance, level of responsibility, and the overall expense of the program. In addition, we also strive to offer benefits competitive with those of our peer group and appropriate perquisites.\n",
      "-->Base Salary\n",
      "-->Base salary represents the fixed component of our executive officers  compensation. The Committee sets base salary levels based upon experience and skills, position, level of responsibility, the ability to replace the individual, and market practices. The Committee reviews base salaries of the executive officers annually and approves all salary increases for the executive officers, including Mr. Drexler. Increases are based on several factors, including the Committee s assessment of individual performance and contribution, promotions, level of responsibility, scope of position, competitive market data, and general economic, retail and business industry conditions, as well as, with respect to our executive officers other than Mr. Drexler, input from Mr. Drexler and the EVP HR.\n",
      "-->In spring 2016, in conjunction with its annual review process, the Committee reviewed base salaries for the Named Executive Officers. The Committee decided that Mr. Drexler s base salary was to remain at $200,000 given his role as owner-manager. This salary is well below the salary level normally provided to a Chief Executive Officer of a company of comparable size, complexity, and performance and below the median level of our peer group.  The Committee also determined that Ms. Lyons ; Mr. Nicholson s; and Ms. Markoe s base salaries would remain at $1,000,000; $800,000; and $550,000, respectively.  In spring 2016, Ms. Wadle received a $100,000 salary increase resulting in a base salary of $850,000, based upon a review of competitive market data.\n",
      "-->Annual Cash Incentives\n",
      "-->Our Named Executive Officers typically have the opportunity to earn cash incentives for meeting annual performance goals. Historically, before the end of the first quarter of the relevant fiscal year, the Committee establishes financial and performance targets and opportunities for such year, which are based upon the Company s goals for Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA).\n",
      "-->48\n",
      "-->The Company s goals for EBITDA are linked to our budget and plan for long-term success. These EBITDA performance targets are the key measures used to determine whether an incentive award will be paid for the fiscal year and, to the extent achieved, det ermine the range of the incentive award opportunity for the Named Executive Officers. We calculate EBITDA using the net income recorded for the Company in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), adding back interest, depreciation, amortization and income tax expenses for the applicable fiscal year. We also adjust for items such as non-cash share-based compensation, the impact of purchase accounting resulting from the Acquisition, non-cash impairment losses and charges related to a w orkforce reduction (as so calculated,  Adjusted EBITDA ).\n",
      "-->Annual incentive awards to our Named Executive Officers are paid from the same incentive pool used for all of our eligible associates. For fiscal 2016, the potential size of the total pool was determined by the Company s performance against pre-established Adjusted EBITDA goals for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2017, which were approved by the Committee on April 22, 2016  as follows:  for Adjusted EBITDA of $181.4 million, the pool would be funded at 25% of the target amount; for Adjusted EBITDA of $240.2 million, the pool would be funded at 100% of the target amount, for Adjusted EBITDA of $318.0 million, the pool would be funded at 200% of the target amount, and for Adjusted EBITDA of more than $318.0 million, the pool could be funded at up to 250% of the target amount at the discretion of the Committee.\n",
      "-->The target amount of the incentive pool is determined by calculating the sum of the target incentive award amount assigned to each plan participant. Mr. Drexler s target award for fiscal 2016 is $1,200,000, as defined in his employment agreement, with a range of potential payment from $0 to $3,000,000. Target awards of the Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Drexler, are expressed as a percentage of annual base salary for the relevant fiscal year. The target award for Ms. Lyons and Ms. Wadle for fiscal 2016 is 100%, with a range of potential payments from 0% to 250% of annual base salary. The target award for Ms. Markoe is 75%, with a range of potential payments from 0% to 187.5% of annual base salary. Mr. Nicholson s employment agreement provided that his annual bonus for fiscal 2016 would be not less than $600,000.\n",
      "-->If the Company does not meet the threshold Adjusted EBITDA target, then no payments are made to the Named Executive Officers with respect to the annual incentive awards plan.\n",
      "-->The Committee determines the amount of Mr. Drexler s annual incentive award independently of management, with no fixed or specific mathematical weighting applied to the performance metrics or any element of his individual performance. The Committee approves his incentive award based upon the Adjusted EBITDA results and achievement of the performance metrics and other business performance factors they deem relevant.\n",
      "-->The Committee determines the amount of the annual incentive awards for the other Named Executive Officers using its discretion, subject to the maximum specified in the plan. In making this determination, the Committee takes into account the recommendations of Mr. Drexler. Each of the other Named Executive Officers reports directly to Mr. Drexler. Mr. Drexler takes significant time to review both the quantitative and qualitative performance results of each such executive and recommends to the Committee an incentive award amount for each of them. Provided the threshold Adjusted EBITDA target is achieved, Mr. Drexler then considers whether to recommend payouts for individuals at the level established by Adjusted EBITDA results and within the range established by each Named Executive Officer s target incentive. Final annual incentive awards are established based on the overall judgment of the Committee, taking into account the recommendations made by Mr. Drexler, with no fixed or specific mathematical weighting applied to any element of individual performance.\n",
      "-->For fiscal 2016, the Company achieved pre-bonus Adjusted EBITDA of $202.2 million and therefore the annual incentive award pool was funded at 50%. In determining the size of individual bonuses, the Committee may increase or reduce amounts if in its sole judgement such an adjustment is appropriate. Individual bonuses were determined by the Committee on March 17, 2017, and will be paid as follows.  Mr. Drexler will receive $600,000, representing 50% of his target bonus payment. Mr. Nicholson will receive $600,000, representing 75% of his annual base salary. Ms. Lyons will receive $400,000, representing 40% of her annual base salary. Ms. Wadle will receive $340,000, representing 40% of her annual base salary. And Ms. Markoe will receive $206,250, representing 37.5% of her annual base salary.  These bonuses are expected to be paid on or before April 13, 2017, the 75\n",
      "-->th\n",
      "-->day of our current fiscal year.\n",
      "-->As noted above, Mr. Nicholson was entitled to an annual cash incentive for fiscal 2016 of not less than $600,000 pursuant to his employment agreement. Therefore, Mr. Nicholson s annual cash incentive will be $600,000. In addition, in April 2016, Mr. Nicholson received a $43,836 cash payment, which represented a pro-rated guaranteed fiscal 2015 bonus of $800,000, pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement. Ms. Markoe received a $100,000 payment in April 2016 as a discretionary performance bonus.\n",
      "-->49\n",
      "-->Long-Term Equity Incentives\n",
      "-->Our Named Executive Officers  compensation is heavily weighted in long-term equity as we believe stockholder value is achieved through an ownership culture that encourages a focus on long-term performance by our Named Executive Officers and other key associates. By providing our executives with an equity stake in the Company, we are better able to align the interests of our Named Executive Officers and our Sponsors. In establishing long-term equity incentive grants for our Named Executive Officers, the Committee reviews certain factors, including the outstanding equity investment and grants held both by the individual and by our executives as a group, total compensation, performance, vesting dates of outstanding grants, tax and accounting costs, potential dilution and other factors.\n",
      "-->In 2011, our Named Executive Officers and certain key members of management were provided the opportunity to roll over on a tax deferred basis, shares of J.Crew Group, Inc. stock and stock options they held into shares or stock options, as applicable, of the Parent in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition. They were also provided the opportunity to purchase shares of the Parent. As a result, Mr. Drexler contributed an aggregate amount of 2,287,545 shares worth approximately $99.5 million in exchange for an ownership interest in Parent following the Acquisition. Ms. Lyons contributed 30,651 shares and 218,401 stock options in exchange for an ownership interest of approximately $4 million. Ms. Wadle contributed 100,590 stock options, 6,804 shares and $370,692 cash in exchange for an ownership interest of approximately $2 million.  Ms. Markoe contributed 7,663 shares and 45,129 stock options in exchange for an ownership interest of approximately $1 million. Mr. Nicholson was not employed by the Company at the time of the Acquisition.\n",
      "-->The Committee has approved stock option and restricted stock awards to the Named Executive Officers, consistent with its view that long-term equity incentives are an important part of an ownership culture that encourages a focus on long-term performance by our Named Executive Officers and other key associates.  In May 2016, each of Ms. Lyons and Ms. Wadle received grants of (A) 1,000,000 shares of restricted stock subject to time-vesting conditions and (B) 1,000,000 shares of restricted stock subject to performance-vesting conditions, and Ms. Markoe received a grant of (A) 500,000 shares of restricted stock subject to time-vesting conditions and (B) 500,000 shares of restricted stock subject to performance-vesting conditions.\n",
      "-->In fiscal 2016, in order to enhance the incentive value of outstanding stock option awards, we engaged in the stock option re-pricing, in which time-based vesting stock options with an exercise price greater than $0.10 could be exchanged for stock options with an exercise price of $0.10 per share, following which 50% of the vested stock options would remain vested and 50% of the vested stock options, together with all unvested stock options, would be subject to an additional vesting schedule of 4 years (25% per year), and performance-based vesting stock options with an exercise price greater than $0.10 could be exchanged for stock options with an exercise price of $0.10 per share and the same performance-vesting hurdles.  Stock options rolled over in the Acquisition were not eligible to participate in the stock option re-pricing.\n",
      "-->Equity Ownership. We believe that Company executives should have a meaningful ownership stake in the Company to underscore the importance of linking executive and investor interests, and to encourage an owner-manager and long-term perspective in managing the business. This ownership stake has been achieved through the roll-over of shares and stock options, the opportunity for cash investment and the award of stock options and restricted stock.\n",
      "-->Benefits and Perquisites. Benefits are provided to our Named Executive Officers in the same manner that they are provided to all other associates. Our Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Company s 401(k) plan (which includes a Company match component) and receive the same health, life, and disability benefits available to our associates generally.\n",
      "-->We offer all of our associates (including the Named Executive Officers) and directors a discount on most merchandise in our stores, and through our e-commerce business. We offer this discount because it is beneficial to our Company to encourage associates and directors to shop in our stores and online. Additionally, this discount represents common practice in the retail industry. This discount is extended to IRS-qualified dependents and spouses.\n",
      "-->We do not offer a defined benefit pension, supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) or a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to our associates or Named Executive Officers.\n",
      "-->In addition, from time to time the Company agrees to provide certain executives with perquisites. The Company provides these perquisites on a limited basis in order to attract key talent and to enhance business efficiency. We believe these perquisites are in line with market practice. For fiscal 2016, we provided certain Named Executive Officers with the following perquisites:\n",
      "-->Driver. We provide Mr. Drexler with a driver for all business needs. Mr. Drexler reimburses the Company for his personal use of the driver, including commuting to and from work.\n",
      "-->50\n",
      "-->Medical Concierge Service. We provide Mr. Drexler with 24/7, on-call worldwide medic al care for himself and his immediate family members, up to a maximum of $50,000 per year.\n",
      "-->The cost incurred by the Company for certain of these perquisites is detailed in the Summary Compensation Table.\n",
      "-->Tax Gross-ups. Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Drexler s employment agreement, Mr. Drexler is entitled to receive a gross up in the event that any payment or benefit provided to him in connection with a change in control (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) occurring after our equity securities once again are publicly traded is subject to the excise taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Code. If a change in control occurs while the Company is private, the Company and Mr. Drexler will use their reasonable best efforts to seek shareholder approval of any parachute payments. These provisions were negotiated as a part of Mr. Drexler s employment agreement in connection with the Acquisition. While other executive officers may also have excess parachute payments that are subject to the excise taxes, no such other executive officer is entitled to a tax gross up from the Company.\n",
      "-->Employment Agreements\n",
      "-->From time to time, the Company enters into employment agreements in order to attract and retain key executives. Each of Messrs. Drexler and Nicholson and Mss. Lyons and Wadle are party to an employment agreement with the Company. As described in a section that follows, the employment agreements generally define the executive s position, specify a minimum base salary, and provide for participation in our annual and long-term incentive plans, as well as other benefits. Most of the agreements contain covenants that limit the executives  ability to compete with us or solicit our associates or customers for a specified period following termination. The agreements also provide for various benefits under certain termination scenarios. In general, these benefits consist of salary continuation for periods ranging from 12 to 18 months, a pro-rata or full cash incentive award for the year in which termination occurred, and in some cases, the acceleration or continued vesting (in accordance with the original vesting schedule) of a portion of unvested equity. The agreements provide for automatic renewal upon the same terms and conditions, unless either party gives written notice of its intent not to renew. The provisions vary by executive because each agreement is negotiated by the Company and the Named Executive Officer on an individual basis at the time of hire or renewal, as applicable. We believe that these agreements enhance our ability to recruit and retain the Named Executive Officers, offer them a degree of security in the very dynamic environment of the retail industry, and protect us competitively through non-competition and non-solicitation requirements if the executives terminate their employment with us.\n",
      "-->The section below contains information, both narrative and tabular, regarding the types of compensation paid to (i) our principal executive officer, (ii) our principal financial officer,  and (iii) our other three most highly compensated executive officers as of the end of fiscal 2016 (collectively, the  Named Executive Officers ). The Summary Compensation Table contains an overview of the amounts paid to our Named Executive Officers for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, as applicable. The tables following the Summary Compensation Table the Grants of Plan-Based Awards, Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End, and Option Exercises and Stock Vested contain details of our Named Executive Officers  recent non-equity incentive and equity grants, past equity awards, general equity holdings, and option exercises. Finally, we have included a table showing potential severance payments to our Named Executive Officers pursuant to their individual employment agreements and certain of our equity incentive plans, assuming, for these purposes that the relevant triggering event occurred on January 28, 2017.\n",

The agreement provides for an initial term of employment through March 7, 2015, subject to automatic renewal for successive one-year periods thereafter unless either Mr. Drexler or the Company provides a notice of non-renewal at least 90 days before the expiration of the then current term. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Drexler receives a base salary of $200,000 and has an opportunity to earn an annual bonus award, with a target opportunity of $1,200,000, based on the achievement of certain performance metrics determined by the Board or a committee thereof. Mr. Drexler is eligible to participate in the Company s employee benefit plans and the Company will pay or reimburse Mr. Drexler for an amount of up to $50,000 per year for the cost of maintaining the benefits provided under one or more concierge medical services arrangements to be selected by Mr. Drexler. In the event that Mr. Drexler s employment is terminated prior to the end of the initial four-year term or any subsequent one-year extension of the term without cause or by Mr. Drexler for good reason (each as defined in the agreement), Mr. Drexler will receive, among other things (i) a payment equal to any accrued but unpaid base salary as of the date of termination, the value of any accrued vacation pay, and the amount of any expenses properly incurred by Mr. Drexler prior to the termination date and not yet reimbursed, (ii) a payment equal to one year s base salary plus Mr. Drexler s target bonus, (iii) a payment equal to the pro-rated annual bonus that Mr. Drexler would have earned for the year in which his termination occurs, based on the actual achievement of applicable performance objectives in the performance year in which the termination date occurs; and (iv) the immediate vesting of all equity awards previously granted to Mr. Drexler that remain outstanding as of the termination date. The agreement also provides that Mr. Drexler is entitled to a full gross up for excise taxes incurred under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code in connection with any change in control occurring after our equity securities once again become publicly traded.\n",
      "-->As described above, pursuant to the terms of the agreement Mr. Drexler received an option grant under Parent s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2011 Equity Incentive Plan ) in fiscal year 2011. These options will vest upon meeting certain time- and performance-based vesting conditions and will vest in full upon, as described above, a termination of his employment without cause or by him for good reason. Mr. Drexler s time-vesting options will vest in full upon the occurrence of a change in control. The agreement also provides that Mr. Drexler will be subject to non-solicitation and non-competition covenants during his employment and for a period of two years and one year, respectively, following the termination of his employment, regardless of the reason for such termination.  In 2016, Mr. Drexler participated in the stock option re-pricing and exchanged 12,040,957 time-based vesting options with an exercise price of $0.25 per share for 6,020,479 vested stock options with an exercise price of $0.10 per share and 6,020,478 unvested stock options with an exercise price of $0.10 per share and an additional 4 year time-based vesting period.

For fiscal year 2016, Mr. Nicholson s employment agreement provides that his annual bonus will not be less than $600,000, provided he remains employed through the payment date.  Under the agreement Mr. Nicholson is subject to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants during his employment and for a period of 12 and 18 months, respectively, following termination of employment for any reason, provided that the non-competition covenants will not apply following termination of Mr. Nicholson s employment by the Company without cause or by him for good reason. In the event his employment is terminated without cause, for good reason or due to his death or disability, Mr. Nicholson is entitled under the agreement to certain post-employment compensation, as detailed in a section that follows.\n",
      "-->Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Mr. Nicholson received restricted stock and stock option grants under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan in January 2016.  We granted Mr. Nicholson 2.5 million shares of restricted Class A common stock that vests periodically based on continued employment over five years.  In addition, we granted Mr. Nicholson 1.5 million shares of restricted Class A common stock that vests based on the achievement of performance goals, within a term of ten years, generally subject to his continued employment prior to the vesting date.  In the event that the performance conditions are satisfied or a change in control of the Company occurs within six months following the termination of Mr. Nicholson s employment by the Company without cause or by Mr. Nicholson for good reason, Mr. Nicholson s performance-based restricted stock will vest to the same extent that it would have vested had Mr. Nicholson remained employed through the satisfaction of the performance conditions or the occurrence of the change in control.  In addition, with respect to both the time and performance-based vesting restricted stock grants, in the event that a change in control of the Company occurs while Mr. Nicholson remains employed, any unvested outstanding restricted stock will vest in full, unless the administrator provides for a cash-out of the award, or the acquirer assumes or substitutes the award.\n",

      "-->We also granted Mr. Nicholson nonqu alified stock options to acquire 2 million shares of Class A common stock, with an exercise price of $.10 per share.  The stock options are subject to time-based vesting over five years.  In the event that Mr. Nicholson s employment ceases within two years following a change in control as a result of a termination by the Company without cause or by Mr. Nicholson for good reason, the unvested outstanding stock options, or any deferred cash or property granted in substitution for such options, will vest in fu ll.  In the event of Mr. Nicholson s termination of employment by the Company without cause or a resignation by Mr. Nicholson for good reason, he will receive an additional 12 months service credit toward vesting of his time-based vesting restricted stock and stock options.\n",

      "-->The audit committee has established policies and procedures regarding the pre-approval of audit and other services that our independent auditor may perform for us. Under the policy, the audit committee has pre-approved the engagement of our independent auditors to perform specific audit, audit related, tax and other non-audit services, subject to the fee limits established from time to time by the Audit Committee, as being consistent with auditor independence.  The provision of all other services, and all generally pre-approved services in excess of the applicable fee limits, by the independent registered public accounting firm must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee on a case-by-case basis.  Management updates the Audit Committee at regularly scheduled meetings about the pre-approved services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm since the last Audit Committee meeting.  Requests to provide services that require separate approval by the Audit Committee  must be submitted to the Audit Committee by both the independent registered public accounting firm and the Chief Financial Officer and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the request is consistent with the SEC s and the PCAOB s rules on auditor independence.  The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one of its members and has currently delegated such authority to the Audit Committee s Chair.  All pre-approved decisions made by the Chair must be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.\n",
      "-->For fiscal 2016, the Audit Committee established fee limits on pre-approved services outside the scope of the pre-approved annual audit engagement of up to $200,000 in the aggregate for statutory audits or financial audits for subsidiaries of the Company; up to $20,000 for audits of the Company s 401(k) Savings Plan; up to $150,000 for sales and use tax compliance; up to $50,000 in the aggregate for VAT compliance and indirect tax advice for certain foreign subsidiaries; and up to $250,000 for services associated with SEC registration statements, periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other documents issued in connection with securities offerings and assistance in responding to SEC comment letters.\n",

In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.\n",
      "-->We conducted our audits in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n",

Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.\n",

      "-->1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n",
      "-->(a) Basis of Presentation\n",
      "-->J.Crew Group, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the  Company  or  Group ) was acquired (the  Acquisition ) on March 7, 2011 through a merger with a subsidiary of Chinos Holdings, Inc. (the  Parent ). The Parent was formed by investment funds affiliated with TPG Capital, L.P. ( TPG ) and Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. ( LGP  and together with TPG, the  Sponsors ). Subsequent to the Acquisition, Group became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, which is owned by affiliates of the Sponsors, co-investors and members of management. Prior to March 7, 2011, the Company operated as a public company with its common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\n",
      "-->All significant intercompany balances and transactions within Group are eliminated in consolidation.\n",
      "-->(b) Business\n",
      "-->The Company designs, contracts for the manufacture of, markets and sells women s, men s and children s apparel, shoes and accessories under the J.Crew and Madewell brand names. The Company s products are marketed primarily in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and France through its retail and factory stores, and its websites and catalogs.\n",
      "-->The Company is subject to seasonal fluctuations in its merchandise sales and results of operations. The Company expects its revenues generally to be lower in the first and second quarters than in the third and fourth quarters (which includes the holiday season) of each fiscal year.\n",
      "-->A significant amount of the Company s products are produced in Asia through arrangements with independent contractors. As a result, the Company s operations could be adversely affected by political instability resulting in the disruption of trade from the countries in which these contractors are located or by the imposition of additional duties or regulations relating to imports or by the contractor s inability to meet the Company s production requirements.\n",
      "-->(c) Fiscal Year\n",
      "-->The Company s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, ended on January 28, 2017, January 30, 2016, and January 31, 2015, respectively, and each consisted of 52 weeks.\n",
      "-->(d) Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\n",
      "-->Management is required to make estimates and assumptions about future events in preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of loss contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management believes that past estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate, current estimates are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events are made. Management evaluates estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicates those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on reasonable factors. Since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n",
      "-->(e) Revenue Recognition\n",
      "-->Revenue is recognized at the point of sale in the stores, and at an estimated date of receipt by the customer in the e-commerce business. Prices for all merchandise are listed in the Company s websites and catalogs and are confirmed with the customer upon order. The customer has no cancellation privileges other than customary rights of return. The Company accrues a sales return allowance for estimated returns of merchandise that will occur subsequent to the balance sheet date, but relate to sales prior to the balance sheet date. The Company presents taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n",

      "-->J.CREW GROUP, INC.\n",
      "-->NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n",
      "-->For the Years Ended January 28, 2017, January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015\n",
      "-->(Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated)\n",
      "-->A liability is recognized at the time a gift card is sold, and revenue is recognized at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. Revenue is deferred and a liability is recognized for gift cards issued in connection with the Company s customer loyalty program. Any unredeemed loyalty gift cards are recognized as income in the period in which they expire.\n",
      "-->Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees are recorded in other revenues. Other revenues also include (i) income from unredeemed gift cards, estimated based on Company specific historical trends, which amounted to $5,208 in fiscal 2016, $4,539 in fiscal 2015, and $4,101 in fiscal 2014, and (ii) revenues from third party resellers, which amounted to $29,107 in fiscal 2016, $24,088 in fiscal 2015, and $9,012 in fiscal 2014.\n",
      "-->(f) Merchandise Inventories\n",
      "-->Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market. The Company capitalizes certain design, purchasing and warehousing costs in inventory and these costs are included in cost of goods sold as the inventories are sold.\n",
      "-->(g) Advertising and Catalog Costs\n",
      "-->Direct response advertising, which consists primarily of catalog production and mailing costs, are capitalized and amortized over the expected future revenue stream. Amortization of capitalized advertising costs is computed using the ratio of current period revenues for the catalog cost pool to the total of current and estimated future period revenues for that catalog cost pool. The capitalized costs of direct response advertising are amortized, commencing with the date catalogs are mailed, over the duration of the expected revenue stream, which is approximately two months. Deferred catalog costs, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, as of January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 were $4,789 and $6,452, respectively. Catalog costs, which are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $41,268 in fiscal 2016, $48,533 in fiscal 2015, and $47,372 in fiscal 2014.\n",
      "-->All other advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, were $63,427 in fiscal 2016, $71,095 in fiscal 2015, and $63,278 in fiscal 2014.\n",
      "-->(h) Lease-Related Deferred Credits\n",
      "-->Rental payments under operating leases are charged to expense on a straight-line basis after consideration of rent holidays, step rent provisions and escalation clauses. Differences between rental expense, which is recognized from the date of possession, and actual rental payments are recorded as deferred rent and included in deferred credits.\n",
      "-->The Company receives construction allowances upon entering into certain store leases. These construction allowances are recorded as deferred credits and are amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the related lease. Deferred construction allowances were $83,028 and $83,347 at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively.\n",
      "-->Additionally, in connection with the Acquisition, the Company recorded liabilities for unfavorable lease commitments, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease life, which aggregated to $4,733 and $7,478 at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively.\n",
      "-->(i) Share-Based Compensation\n",
      "-->The fair value of time-based employee awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award. The fair value of the options exercisable when certain owners of the Parent receive a specified level of cash proceeds from the sale of their initial investment will not be recognized until such event is deemed probable. Determining the fair value of options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility and the expected dividend yield. Upon grant of awards, the Company also estimates an amount of forfeitures that will occur prior to vesting. See note 4 for more information regarding share-based awards.\n",

      "-->(Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated)\n",
      "-->(j) Property and Equipment\n",
      "-->Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives of twenty years. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over estimated useful lives, ranging from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or related lease terms (without consideration of optional renewal periods).\n",
      "-->The Company capitalizes certain costs (included in fixtures and equipment) related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.\n",
      "-->(k) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n",
      "-->The Company reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of such assets based upon estimated cash flow forecasts. Charges for impairment of long-lived assets were $7,752 in fiscal 2016, $4,522 in fiscal 2015 and $2,785 in fiscal 2014. See notes 3 and 9 for more information regarding impairment of long-lived assets.\n",
      "-->(l) Income Taxes\n",
      "-->The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred taxes are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The provision for income taxes includes taxes currently payable and deferred taxes resulting from the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities.\n",
      "-->The Company maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowances are included in the Company s tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the Company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.\n",
      "-->With respect to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, the Company recognizes in its financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a  more likely than not  threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement.\n",
      "-->The Company recognizes interest expense and income related to income taxes as a component of interest expense, and penalties as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.\n",
      "-->(m) Segment Information\n",
      "-->The Company has two operating segments, J.Crew and Madewell, which are aggregated into one reportable segment. The Company s identifiable assets are located primarily in the United States. Export sales are not material.\n",
      "-->(n) Cash and Cash Equivalents\n",
      "-->The Company considers all highly liquid marketable securities, with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents, which were $96,450 and $50,103 at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively, are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value.\n",
      "-->(o) Operating Expenses\n",
      "-->Cost of goods sold (including buying and occupancy costs) includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, freight, design, buying and production costs, occupancy costs related to store operations, and all shipping and handling and delivery costs.\n",

      "-->Selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating expenses not included in cost of goods sold, primarily catalog production and mailing costs, administrative payroll, store expenses other than occupancy costs, depreciation and amortizati on, certain warehousing expenses (aggregating to $ 40,841 in fiscal 2016, $44,164 in fiscal 2015 and $43,442 in fiscal 2014) and credit card fees.\n",
      "-->(p) Deferred Financing Costs\n",
      "-->Deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the related debt agreements. The amortization is included in interest expense, net.\n",

      "-->Costs associated with the opening of new stores are expensed as incurred.\n",
      "-->(r) Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n",
      "-->The Acquisition of the Company was accounted for as a purchase business combination, whereby the purchase price paid was allocated to recognize the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. In connection with the purchase price allocation, intangible assets were established for the J.Crew and Madewell trade names, loyalty program, customer lists and favorable lease commitments. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill, which consists primarily of intangible assets related to the knowhow, design and merchandising abilities that do not qualify for separate recognition.\n",
      "-->Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the J.Crew trade name and goodwill, are not subject to amortization. The Company assesses the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangibles whenever there are indicators of impairment, or at least annually in the fourth quarter. If the recorded carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company records a charge to write the intangible asset down to its fair value. Definite-lived intangibles, such as the Madewell trade name and favorable lease commitments, are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful life or remaining lease term. See note 3 for more information regarding goodwill and intangible assets of the Company.\n",
      "-->The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, which consists of its operating segments, J.Crew and Madewell, of which only Madewell has goodwill. In this assessment, the Company first compares the estimated enterprise fair value of the Madewell reporting unit to its recorded carrying value. The Company estimates the enterprise fair value based on a combination of an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow, a market approach, and a transaction approach. If the recorded carrying value of the Madewell reporting unit exceeds its estimated enterprise fair value in the first step, a second step is performed in which the Company allocates the enterprise fair value to the fair value of the Madewell s net assets. The second step of the impairment testing process requires, among other things, estimates of fair values of substantially all of the Company s tangible and intangible assets. Any enterprise fair value in excess of amounts allocated to such net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill for Madewell. If the recorded goodwill balance for Madewell exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write goodwill down to its fair value. See note 3 for more information regarding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.\n",
      "-->(s) Dividends\n",
      "-->Dividends are recorded at the declaration date as a reduction of retained earnings included in stockholders  equity (deficit). If the amount of the dividend exceeds retained earnings, the dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.\n",
      "-->(t) Foreign Currency Translation\n",
      "-->The financial statements of the Company s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, equity accounts at historical exchange rates, while revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income, but are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders  equity (deficit). As of January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, foreign currency translation adjustments resulted in accumulated losses of $1,581 and accumulated gains of $200, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) included in operating results were $1.5 million in fiscal 2016, $(2.0) million in fiscal 2015 and $(5.5) in fiscal 2014.\n",

      "-->(Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated)\n",
      "-->(u) Derivative Financial Instruments\n",
      "-->The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness. As cash flow hedges, unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. The interest rate swap agreements are highly correlated to the changes in interest rates to which the Company is exposed. Unrealized gains and losses on these instruments are designated as effective or ineffective. The effective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, while the ineffective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of interest expense. Realized gains and losses in connection with each required interest payment are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.\n",
      "-->(v) Reclassification\n",
      "-->Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation. Specifically, the Company adopted an accounting standard which requires certain deferred financing costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction of the carrying amount of that debt liability. The adoption of this pronouncement resulted in the reclassification of $16,301 from long-term assets to long-term liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheet at January 30, 2016.\n",
      "-->2. Management Services Agreement\n",
      "-->Pursuant to a management services agreement entered into in connection with the Acquisition, and in exchange for on-going consulting and management advisory services, the Sponsors receive an aggregate annual monitoring fee prepaid quarterly equal to the greater of (i) 40 basis points of consolidated annual revenues or (ii) $8 million. The Sponsors also receive reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with services provided pursuant to the agreement. The Company recorded an expense of $10.0 million in fiscal 2016, $10.3 million in fiscal 2015, and $10.4 million in fiscal 2014 for monitoring fees and out-of-pocket expenses, included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n",

      "-->In August 2014, the Company entered into interest rate cap and swap agreements that limit exposure to interest rate increases on a portion of the Company s floating rate indebtedness. The interest rate cap agreements covered notional amounts of $400 million and capped LIBOR at 2.00% from March 2015 to March 2016. The interest rate swap agreements cover a notional amount of $800 million from March 2016 to March 2019 and carry a fixed rate of 2.56% plus the applicable margin.\n",
      "-->The Company designated the interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. As cash flow hedges, unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. The interest rate swap agreements are highly correlated to the changes in interest rates to which the Company is exposed. Unrealized gains and losses on this instrument are designated as effective or ineffective. The effective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, while the ineffective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of interest expense. Future realized gains and losses in connection with each required interest payment will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.\n",
      "-->The fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are estimated using industry standard valuation models using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves (level 2).  Liabilities for interest rate swaps, included in other liabilities, were $18.6 million and $31.1 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively.\n",

      "-->The Company uses a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n",
      "--> \n",
      "-->Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n",

      "--> \n",
      "-->Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\n",
      "-->Financial assets and liabilities\n",
      "-->The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated to be $878 million and $1,051 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 based on quoted market prices of the debt (level 1 inputs).\n",
      "-->The Company s interest rate swap agreements are measured in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis. See note 8 for more information regarding the fair value of this financial liability.\n",
      "-->The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.\n",
      "-->Non-financial assets and liabilities\n",
      "-->Certain non-financial assets, including goodwill, the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name, and certain long-lived assets, have been written down and measured in the financial statements at fair value. The Company does not have any other non-financial assets or liabilities as of January 28, 2017 or January 30, 2016 that are measured on a recurring basis in the financial statements at fair value.\n",
      "-->The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill and intangibles whenever there are indicators of impairment, or at least annually in the fourth quarter. If the recorded carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the Company records a charge to write down the intangible asset to its fair value. Impairment charges of goodwill are based on fair value measurements derived using a combination of an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow, a market approach, and a transaction approach. Impairment charges of intangible assets are based on fair value measurements derived using an income approach, specifically relief from royalty method; a revenue and royalty rate approach. The valuation methodologies incorporate unobservable inputs reflecting significant estimates and assumptions made by management (level 3 inputs). For more information related to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, see note 3.\n",
      "-->The Company performs impairment tests of certain long-lived assets whenever there are indicators of impairment. These tests typically contemplate assets at a store level (e.g. leasehold improvements). The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable in light of the undiscounted future cash flows and measures an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset based on discounted future cash flows. The Company has determined that the future cash flow approach (level 3 inputs) provides the most relevant and reliable means by which to determine fair value in this circumstance.\n",

      "-->The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance related to its deferred tax assets.  In making that assessment, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on a weighing process of available e vidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized. In that weighing process, the Company assigns significant weight to the negative evidence of its cumulative losses in recent years.  As a result, in fiscal 2016, the Company determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence, and recorded a non-cash ch arge to income tax expense of $8.2 million to record a valuation allowance related to its deferred tax assets balance. This accounting treatment has no effect on the Company s ability to utilize deferred tax assets to reduce future cash tax payments. The Company will continue to assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable at the end of each reporting period and the valuati on allowance will be adjusted accordingly.\n",
      "-->It is the Company s intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings and profits from the Company s foreign operations that have been generated through January 28, 2017. Future plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the foreign amounts to fund U.S. operations. Cumulative undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries were $69.8 million at January 28, 2017. No deferred federal income taxes were provided for the undistributed earnings as they are permanently reinvested in the Company s international operations. Cash held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries is $21.4 million, valued in U.S. dollars, at January 28, 2017.\n",
      "-->As of January 28, 2017, the Company has $24.6 million in liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions (including interest and penalties of $2.5 million) reflected in other liabilities. The amount, if recognized, that would affect the effective tax rate is $17.5 million. While the Company expects the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months, the change is not expected to have a significant effect on the estimated effective annual tax rate, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the outcome of tax matters is uncertain and unforeseen results can occur.\n",

Drexler, Inc. entered into a Trademark License Agreement whereby Mr. Drexler granted the Company a thirty-year exclusive, worldwide license to use the Madewell trademark and associated intellectual property rights owned by him (the  Properties ). In consideration for the license, the Company reimbursed Mr. Drexler s actual costs expended in acquiring and developing the Properties (which amounted to $242,300) and agreed to pay royalties of $1 per year during the term of the license. In January 2007, the Company provided notice to Mr. Drexler that the Company had met certain conditions outlined in the agreement, and Mr. Drexler assigned to the Company all of his residual rights in the Properties. The Company also agreed that it would not assign or spin off ownership of the Properties during the term of Mr. Drexler s employment without his consent other than as part of a sale of the entire Company (except that the Company may pledge or hypothecate its interest in the Properties as part of a bank or other financings).\n",
      "-->Chinos Intermediate Holdings A, Inc. Senior PIK Toggle Note\n",
      "-->On November 4, 2013 in a private transaction, Chinos Intermediate Holdings A, Inc. (the  Issuer ), an indirect parent holding company of Group, issued $500 million aggregate principal of 7.75/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due May 1, 2019 (the  PIK Notes ).  The PIK Notes pay interest semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. Interest for the first and final interest periods is required to be paid in cash at the cash interest rate of 7.75%. For each other interest period, the Issuer is required to pay interest in cash, unless certain conditions are satisfied, in which case the Issuer may elect to pay PIK interest either by increasing the principal amount or issuing new notes. The PIK interest rate is equal to the cash interest rate plus 75 basis points, or 8.50%.\n",
      "-->The net proceeds of $490 million from this offering were used by the Issuer to fund a cash dividend of $484 million to equity holders, and dividend equivalent compensation payments of $6.1 million to certain equity-award holders.\n",
      "-->The PIK Notes are: (i) senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Issuer s subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the Issuer s subsidiaries, including Group, and therefore are not recorded in the financial statements of the Company. The PIK Notes provide for redemption at certain prices, including with respect to a change in control or equity offering.\n",
      "-->During fiscal 2016, the Issuer made interest payments on the PIK Notes by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. On October 28, 2016, the Issuer also delivered notice to U.S. Bank N.A., as trustee, under the indenture governing the PIK Notes, that with respect to the interest that will be due on such notes on the May 1, 2017 interest payment date, the Issuer will make such interest payment by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. The PIK election will increase the outstanding principal balance of the PIK Notes by $23.1 million to $566.5 million. Therefore, the Company will not pay a dividend to the Issuer in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the PIK Notes, the Issuer intends to evaluate this option prior to the beginning of each interest period based on relevant factors at that time.\n",

      "-->In May 2014, a pronouncement was issued that clarified the principles of revenue recognition, which standardizes a comprehensive model for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers.

The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements.\n",
      "-->In July 2015, a pronouncement was issued that more closely aligns the measurement of inventory in U.S. GAAP with International Financial Reporting Standards by requiring companies using the first-in, first-out and average costs methods to measure inventory using the lower of cost and net realizable value.

However, the adoption is expected to have a significant impact because most of the Company s leases will be subject to these new requirements.\n",
      "-->In August 2016, a pronouncement was issued which aims to reduce the diversity in presentation and classification of the following specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration, insurance proceeds, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interest in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements.\n",
      "-->In January 2017, a pronouncement was issued that simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by no longer requiring an entity to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Instead, impairment will be measured using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
